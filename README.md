# GhostSignal
Built for hostaged hackers under duress.

üî• Purpose
GhostSignal.sh is a covert signaling tool disguised as a malicious Bash script. It was built for one purpose: to help hackers who are being forced to work under duress by narco-terrorist groups or coercive regimes.

This tool simulates a believable hacking operation complete with fake exploits, credential dumps, and brute-force rituals while secretly transmitting an encrypted distress signal to trusted authorities.

It is designed for hostaged hackers who must pretend to build and execute malicious code in front of their captors. GhostSignal lets them perform that illusion while quietly sending metadata that could save their life.

üß¨ How It Works
GhostSignal.sh contains three tactical layers:

Visual Illusion Layer Simulates a hacking session using echo, sleep, and figlet. This is the visible cloak.

Covert Signal Layer Sends encrypted metadata (location, timestamp, device fingerprint) via HTTPS POST to a trusted endpoint.

Trigger Mechanism Activated only when run with the --safe flag. Without it, only the illusion runs.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It
üîπ Step 1: Replace the Endpoint
Inside the script, locate this line: https://your-proxy-endpoint.com/report
Replace it with a real HTTPS endpoint that can receive POST requests. Do NOT use direct FBI or CIA URLs, they do not accept raw POSTs and may flag the request as malicious.

Instead, use:

Webhook.site for testing

A secure proxy relay you control

A future GhostSignal relay server (see roadmap below)

üîπ Step 2: Run the Script
./GhostSignal.sh           # Runs illusion only  
./GhostSignal.sh --safe    # Sends covert signal
The --safe flag activates the whisper. Without it, the script performs only the decoy.

üïµÔ∏è How to Signal Authorities Without Being Detected
Typing fbi.gov or cia.gov directly into the script could alert captors. Instead:

Use a proxy relay that forwards the signal manually or semi-automatically.

Host the relay on a neutral domain (e.g., ghostsanctum.io) that doesn‚Äôt reveal its true purpose.

Encrypt the payload using base64 or GPG so even if intercepted, it‚Äôs unreadable.

Include a code phrase like "auth_phrase": "sanctum-verified" to validate the signal.

This allows the hostaged hacker to run the script without ever typing or revealing the true destination.

üöß Coming Soon: GhostSignal Relay Server
I am currently designing a secure relay server that:

Accepts encrypted payloads from GhostSignal.sh

Validates and archives distress signals

Forwards them to law enforcement and intelligence agencies via approved channels

Includes audit logs, consent gates, and verification rituals

This server will be built with the intent to contract with agencies who need a safe, ethical way to receive signals from hostaged individuals. It will prove that these are not unsolicited POSTs, but real-world tragedies unfolding in real time.

üí° My Vision
I believe in this tool. I believe in the hostaged hacker who risks everything to send a whisper. I believe GhostSignal can make a difference, by turning illusion into lifeline, compliance into rebellion, and silence into signal.

This is not just code. It‚Äôs a civic artifact. A true escape attempt. A digital act of courage.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
GhostSignal.sh is designed for real-world dangerous events. It is a last resort tool for individuals under coercion. There is no guarantee of survival. Using this script is inherently risky, like running away in plain sight.

Use it with caution. Use it with purpose. Use it to reclaim your agency.
